# Python MySQL Integration Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of **Python** with a **MySQL database** to fetch and filter data dynamically based on user input. It showcases a simple yet practical implementation of database querying and interaction using the `mysql.connector` library.

---

## Features
- Connects to a MySQL database.
- Fetches all records from a specific table.
- Allows users to filter data dynamically based on partial name matches.
- Displays the results in a readable format.

---

## Requirements
- **Python 3.7+**
- **MySQL Server**
- **Python Library**: `mysql-connector-python`

---


### Install Dependencies
Make sure you have the `mysql-connector-python` library installed. You can install it using:
pip install mysql-connector-python

### Future Improvements
Add error handling for database connectivity issues.
Enhance the script to support additional filtering criteria (e.g., price range).
Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.
